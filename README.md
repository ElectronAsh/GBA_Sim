# GBA_Sim
A fork of the GBA core, but with the ARM7 translated from VHDL to Verilog, for use with Verilator.

I didn't do a direct fork for this one, as a lot of things have been changed, in an attempt to get it running under my Dear Imgui / Verilator-based debugger.

The original repo is here...

https://github.com/neildryan/GBA

The ARM7 core looks to need some work now to get it running correctly after the Verilog translation.

Once that is working, the files will be properly merged back into the original repo.

ElectronAsh.
